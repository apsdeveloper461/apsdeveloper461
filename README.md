Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about building web experiences that combine creativity with cutting-edge technology, and I love experimenting with new ideas—especially in the world of AI.

## 🚀 About Me

I started my web dev journey over three years ago, and it's been an exciting ride ever since. From tinkering with Django and Node.js on the backend to crafting sleek, dynamic UIs with React.js and Next.js, I’ve loved turning ideas into scalable, real-world solutions.

Lately, I’ve been exploring the world of AI, diving into automation and Generative AI—not just to keep up with trends, but to push boundaries and reimagine user experiences.

Currently building full stack at Xavinex, collaborating with the awesome GDGoC Crew, and always looking to blend code with creativity.

Let’s connect and maybe build something magical. ✨
