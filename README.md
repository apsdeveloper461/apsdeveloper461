## 🚀 About Me

My journey into web development started a little over three years ago, and it’s been a wild, rewarding ride ever since. What began as a curiosity quickly turned into a passion for turning ideas into interactive, scalable web experiences.

I first got my hands dirty with back-end development using **Django** and **Node.js**, then found my flow building sleek, dynamic front-ends with **React.js** and **Next.js**. Over time, I’ve worked with databases like **MongoDB** and **MySQL**—always focused on creating solutions that actually make a difference for real users.

But I’m not just here to build what’s already been built.

Lately, I’ve been diving into the exciting world of **AI**—especially **AI automation** and **Generative AI**. It’s more than just keeping up with trends; it’s about pushing boundaries and reimagining what’s possible online. I’m fascinated by how intelligent systems can transform user experiences—making them more intuitive, personalized, and honestly, kind of magical.

Right now, I’m working as a **Full Stack Developer at Xavinex**, part of the awesome **GDGoC Crew**, and constantly inspired by where tech is headed. Whether I’m building clean, efficient systems or experimenting with creative, AI-driven ideas, I’m always chasing that moment when code meets creativity.

If any of that resonates—let’s connect. Maybe we’ll build something amazing together. ✨
